Quiz 2


ans =

Here are the answers for quiz2:
Suppose L1 looks like this:


L1 =

     1     0     0     0
     8     1     0     0
     9     0     1     0
     5     0     0     1


ans =

We can see that the inverse of L1 
will have the terms below the diagonal 
in the corresponding column negated:


ans =

    1.0000         0         0         0
   -8.0000    1.0000         0         0
   -9.0000         0    1.0000   -0.0000
   -5.0000         0    0.0000    1.0000


ans =

Watch for a similar thing in L2 and L3:


L2 =

     1     0     0     0
     0     1     0     0
     0     9     1     0
     0     2     0     1


ans =

Inverse of L2:


ans =

     1     0     0     0
     0     1     0     0
     0    -9     1     0
     0    -2     0     1


L3 =

     1     0     0     0
     0     1     0     0
     0     0     1     0
     0     0     2     1


ans =

Inverse of L3:


ans =

     1     0     0     0
     0     1     0     0
     0     0     1     0
     0     0    -2     1


ans =

Thus, it is easy to see that to obtain any 
inv(L_i) that we just negate the nondiagonal 
terms in the corresponding L_i matrix


ans =

For part2
The algorithm does not need any extra space 
because once the diagonal has entries of 1, 
we can simply find the inverse easily by observing 
what happened in the previous problem:
We simply negate the terms in the 
corresponding column that are below the 
diagonal in order to find the inverse, 
no extra space is needed.
