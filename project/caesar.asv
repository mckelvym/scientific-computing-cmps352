function X = caesar(x, key, dec)
%implements a caesar cipher
%x is the string to encrypt/decrypt
%key is any value
%dec is the flag to decrypt (pass '1'), any other value encrypts


%make sure they key is within acceptable range
key = mod(key, 96)

%convert to integer representation, base at 0
if(dec==1)
    X = real(x-32) + key;
else
    X = real(x-32) - key;
